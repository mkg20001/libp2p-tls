# libp2p-tls

TLS for libp2p.

Really hacky (but works). No browser support currently.

ToDos:
 - [x] Modularize (split up in files)
 - [x] Refactor logic to use wrapper that is seperate (allows for browser support)
 - [ ] Update README
 - [ ] Make browser tests pass

Future:
 - [ ] Add backwards-compatible tls1.3 support
 - [ ] Add a parameter to let the clients choose between ECC and RSA crypto?
